>__üë¶ Jack Arturo, Founder of WPFusion__
>There are a couple of booking solutions for WordPress but they tend to be complicated, buggy, or require WooCommerce. FluentBooking is the first plugin I've used that can seriously compete with cloud solutions like Calendly (even in the first release! ü§©) It was easy to set up and I was able to accept new appointments with just a few clicks. Thanks WPManageNinja! üß°
