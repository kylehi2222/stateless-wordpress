>__👦 Jack Arturo, Founder of WPFusion__
>There are a couple of booking solutions for WordPress but they tend to be complicated, buggy, or require WooCommerce. FluentBooking is the first plugin I've used that can seriously compete with cloud solutions like Calendly (even in the first release! 🤩) It was easy to set up and I was able to accept new appointments with just a few clicks. Thanks WPManageNinja! 🧡

>__👨 Augustine Mak - Entrepreneur/Educator / funnelstoincome.com__
>Finally, a fantastic and easy way to create bookings in WordPress. Another great opportunity for me to make even more money as an entrepreneur. It’s very easy to use and integrates seamlessly with Fluent Forms for creating advanced booking forms and FluentCRM for email automation. What a game-changer, I highly recommend FluentBooking.

>__👨 Davinder Singh Kainth, Founder, The WP Weekly__
>It is a simple yet powerful solution to get going with online bookings and appointments on a WordPress website. Web agencies should find this useful for their own use and on their client websites. If full control and ownership of data on the WordPress platform is your thing and you are looking to set up an efficient online booking system, FluentBooking solution should feature high on your list.

>__👦 David Risley, Founder, Blog Marketing Academy__
